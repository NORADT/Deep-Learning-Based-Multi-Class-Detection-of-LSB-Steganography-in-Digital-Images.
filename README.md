# Deep Learning-Based Multi-Class Detection of LSB Steganography in Digital Images

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the development and evaluation of deep learning models used to detect and classify least significant bit (LSB)-based steganographic payloads in digital images.

## Files Description

1. **01_payload_detection_project.ipynb**  
   Initial notebook for loading datasets, preprocessing, and basic model training.

2. **02_combined_payload_detection_project.ipynb**  
   Combines different datasets and performs comparative analysis on detection accuracy.

3. **03_combined_models.ipynb**  
   Implements and compares multiple deep learning architectures (CNN, DenseNet, EfficientNet, etc.).

4. **04_ViT_DeiT.ipynb**  
   Focuses on Vision Transformer (ViT) and Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) models for steganography detection.

5. **05_final_version.ipynb**  
   Final optimized version of the model with performance evaluation and results documentation.

## Project Goal
To develop an accurate and efficient deep learning-based system capable of detecting and classifying multiple types of LSB steganographic payloads embedded in images.
